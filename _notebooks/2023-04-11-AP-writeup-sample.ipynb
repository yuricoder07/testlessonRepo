    "    - The purpose of this program is to add and display users and their identity information.  \n",
    "    - The purpose could grow as Web Applications typically require user accounts.  The purpose could grow, as the current features could serve as the basis of a future system, where users and identity information could be used to control access to the future Web Application features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video.\n",
    "    - Demo #1.  Demonstrated first is the frontend JavaScript/HTML/CSS program.  This program is used to Create and Read users.  This has a public URL and is deployed on a GitHub pages server.\n",
    "        - Users are displayed when the page is loaded.  The listing, which is in table format, contains common identity information required for a user/account system.  \n",
    "        - The information in the page is actually read from a different web application, the backend system.  The users are retrieved from a backend web application, which is hosted on an entirely different server.  The users are stored in an SQLite Database and retrieved from this other web application via a backend Web API endpoint, using a GET method\n",
    "        - Additionally, in the video shows the process for adding/creating new user information, this is with an API and enpoint using a POST Method.   After the POST, the information input on screen is validated and updated in the backend SQLite database, also it is updated on frontend Web page.\n",
    "    - Demo #2.  Demos the capability of testing the backend API server without the need of the frontend Web Page.  This show that it is accessing a public URL, this web application is hosted on an AWS EC2 server.\n",
    "    - Demo #3 (Did not make time cut).  The final demo illustrates how to create and modify the database while developing on a localhost.  Using Visual Studio Code, eliminating Frontend, API layers, and Servers... The Developer process allows for the creating of the database table and and adding rows to the users table on localhost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video.\n",
    "    - In Demo #1, on page load JavaScript obtains data using the backend GET API, the response from the API containing JSON.   This JSON file is a collection containing a list of key/values which is iterated over in a JavaScript for loop row by row, each row outputs a corresponding to a row on the Web Page.  The resulting table contains each user and their corresponding columnar data. \n",
    "    - In the seconde part of Demo #1, demos creating new user information using the backend POST API enpoint.  In this case, the data input is passed in the request body.  The backend receives the API, validates, and unpacks the JSON data into a Python User object.  The User object contains a method to Create a new row in the SQLite table.  After data is validated, the row is created.  The created row is repacked in JSON and returned as a response to the JavaScript sequence.  On return, the data is displayed in the HTM.\n"

    "    - Also, there is a method to set the date of birth, ```uo.dob = datetime.strptime(dob, '%Y-%m-%d').date()```.  Behind the scenes this calculates an ```age``` attribute for the user.\n",
    "    - Ultimately, after object is generated and all data is verified, the ```uo.create()``` method is called and a new row is committed into the database table.  In this step, all the commands required to interact with the SQL database have been abstracted into the \"uo\" object.\n",
    "    - There are ways to write the ```class User``` code differently!  Primarly to make the code into a imperative sequence and perform everything done within the object into a serialized form of commands.  However, this would minimize the possibilities for code reuse.  For instance, in a ***User Management System*** there would be a need to ***Update*** user records, as well as the described ***Create*** user functionality.   The User class and creating a ```uo``` object could contain leveraged methods to support ***Update*** functionality.  For instance, the same  ```password``` and ```dob``` mutator/setter methods would work for update.  Thus, an Update API would be able to use these abstracted methods with similar code.   \n",
    "    - The concept of passing a list of Key/Value pairs through JSON, as illustrated with ```body``` variable is a foundation piece for REST API development.\n",
    "    - The concept of creating/updating a user object (```uo```) is common to Object Oriented Programming (OOP).  This enables the management of an Object (ie user object), which is a list or series of data elements, along with the code to mutate and access that data in a reusable and reliable object.  All things in code can be done in alternative ways, but OOP is great way to manage complexity on a list of attributes describing a User.  \n",
    "    - Any additions to attributes managed in User class would require code additions, but the places of addition is well defined, ordered, and understood by the developer.  Key methods like uo.create() would not be changed.\n",
    "    - After data creation, objects from the class can be used for a mariad of other purposes.  Obtaining a Database List or Collection using the User Class with its database properties allow for things like querying the data.  In  API preparation there is a need for code that returns a response of all uo objects to the frontend."
