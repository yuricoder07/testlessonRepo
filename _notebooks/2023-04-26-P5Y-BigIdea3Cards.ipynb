    "\n",
    "- Reviewing types of variables\n",
    "- Reviewing algorithms and procedures\n",
    "    - Iteration\n",
    "    - Selection\n",
    "- The purpose of simulations and their possible benefits\n",
    "    - Our simulation will include an SQLite table\n",

    "### Lesson Plans\n",
    " \n",
    "- We will use \"fill in the blanks\" as lesson interactions\n",
    "- We will have code segments for them to base their notes on\n",
